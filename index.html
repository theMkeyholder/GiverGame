    <h1>Backstory</h1>
    
    <p>
      Memories are an integral part of the Community. Jonas is tasked with having the integrity to not flee, and is exempt from some rules. However, why should Jonas continue to put up with the irrational assertion that Sameness is good for the community? Jonas robs the community of leftovers, which would have been a major transgression that he would have gotten an infraction for. Jonas faces the perils of escaping the community and must stay obscured from the security planes that gravitate toward him. Can he make it?
